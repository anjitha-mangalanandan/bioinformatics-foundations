# Week 1 - Linux basics for Bioinformatics

## Overview
This week focused on building foundational Linux command-line skills essential for Bioinformatics

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Terminal Navigation
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `ls` - List directory contents
- `cd` - Change directory

### 2. File and Directory Management
- `mkdir` - Create directories
- `touch` - Create files
- `copy` - Copy files
- `mv` - Move/Rename files
- `rm` - Remove files

### 3. Project Organisation
Created structured directories for bioinformatics workflow:

```
.
├── README.md
├── data
├── notes
├── processed_data
├── raw_data
├── results
└── scripts
```

---

## Practical Exercises Completed

- Created and navigated multiple directories
- Organised mock datasets
- Renamed and moved files
- Deleted unnecessary files
- Cloned GitHub repository
- Configured Git (user.name and user.email)
- Committed and pushed changes to remote repository
- Installed and used th `tree` command to visualise directory structure

---

## Key Learnings

- Linux command line is powerful and efficient for handling biological datasets.
- Proper directory structure is critical for reproducible research.
- Git version control is essential for tracking bioinformatics workflows.
- GitHub integration enables project documentation and portfolio building.

---

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Git
- GitHub

## Reflection

This week established the foundation for working with bioinformatics pipelines. Mastery of Linux is essential before moving to text processing tools, scripting, and NGS workflows.

Next: Advanced command-line tools (grep, awk, sed, piping, permissions, bash scripting).
